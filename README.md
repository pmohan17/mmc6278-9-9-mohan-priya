# Accomplishments App
## Purpose
According to the American Institute of Stress, almost 60% of Americans feel paralyzed by their stress. And over 94% feel stress at the workplace. This app encourages you to take some time to celebrate you. Each day, add in one thing you accomplished to your personal space. The users posts are meant to be private for them to see. Additionally, users are able to randomly select an inspirational quote as needed. The purpose of this app is to uplift individuals among  the chaotic stress of daily life.

## Function
Unfortunately, there were a few bugs in deploying this that time did not permit me to work on. For example, at the moment, the function to update and delete a post isn't available. Additionally, it only shows one post at a time. I suspect this is a handlebars issue that I could not figure out. All data is successfully shown in MongoDB. I hope to continue working on this to fix the issue.

## Deployment
- Clone this repository
- Run locally in http://localhost:3000/
- Visit your accomplishments page
- This is also viewable in Github on https://mongo-project-db-8099bd66a799.herokuapp.com/

## Future Considerations
Once I get this app working, I do believe I would use an app like this. I rarely find time to journal but find satisfaction in writing the highlights of my day.

Above is the screen you find once you log in.

You'll notice the header reverts in this section. This only happens once the form is submitted. Therefore, I assume this is a form submission error.
